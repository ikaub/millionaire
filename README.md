Welcome to the my test task project! I tried to make it configurable with game.config.ts<br />
To add new styles you would need to create new .scss file in your component's folder and then import it inside of index.scss<br/>
To run the project, please enter in your cmd or terminal (NodeJS must be installed):

### `npm run start`

Then go to the

## <a href="http://localhost:3000">localhost</a>

and test the project.
<br/>

Whenever you make a new commit, ESLint and Prettier run to guarantee the code quality. Whenever you push this code via <br/>

## git push origin [branch]

Unit tests run to ensure that code to be pushed doesn't ruin the project's logic.
